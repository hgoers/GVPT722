The only reason these estimates are different is random chance.\nThis is okay! But remember, we always need to be upfront about this uncertainty. Generally, we need to accept that 95% of these possible values of our coefficient could be the true coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe average estimate of the dem coefficient created from these repeated random samples will be the true estimate because this sample is not biased.1 We will talk about that more shortly.\n\n\nWe cannot take an infinite number of random samples of our population to calculate these possible values. In fact, we often cannot take more than one random sample of our population. So, we need a strategy that maximizes the chance that the single random sample we draw will produce an estimate of our coefficient that is as close to the true coefficient as possible. To do this, we need to tighten the spread of these possible values around their mean (our best guess at the true coefficient). In other words, we want to more consistent estimates.\nHow do we do this? We increase our sample size! In other words, we increase the amount of information we are using to build our understanding of the relationship between individuals’ feelings towards Obama and their political affiliation.\nTo demonstrate, let’s first look at repeated samples of 300 people, or 5% of the survey respondents. Then let’s also look at repeated samples of 1,000 people, or 17% of the survey respondents.\n\nnes_300_dem_estimates &lt;- map(rep(300, 1000), random_sample_nes)\n\nnes_1000_dem_estimates &lt;- map(rep(1000, 1000), random_sample_nes)\n\n\ntibble(sample_size = 100, \n       beta_dem = unlist(nes_100_dem_estimates)) |&gt; \n  bind_rows(\n    tibble(\n      sample_size = 300,\n      beta_dem = unlist(nes_300_dem_estimates)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  bind_rows(\n    tibble(\n      sample_size = 1000,\n      beta_dem = unlist(nes_1000_dem_estimates)\n    )\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = beta_dem, fill = factor(sample_size))) + \n  stat_halfeye(alpha = 0.5) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") + \n  labs(fill = \"Sample size\")\n\n\n\n\nThe larger our sample size, the narrower the range of plausible alternative values of the dem coefficient are. They are more consistent.\nThe more consistently we produce estimates of our coefficient of interest, the more confident we can be that any single random sample from our population will tell us something close to the truth about the relationship between our dependent and independent variables.\n\n\nBias\nAt the end of the day, we are interested in that coefficient. We want to get as close as possible to the true coefficient (or the true relationship between our predictors and outcome of interest). Therefore, we want to avoid bias.\nTo illustrate, let’s see what happens to our understanding of the relationship between an individual’s feelings towards Obama and their party affiliation if we only look at male respondents.\n\nnes_men &lt;- nes |&gt; \n  filter(gender == \"Male\") |&gt; \n  select(caseid, obama_therm, dem, gender)\n\nglimpse(nes_men)\n\nRows: 2,847\nColumns: 4\n$ caseid      &lt;dbl&gt; 408, 3282, 1942, 118, 5533, 5880, 1651, 6687, 5903, 629, 1…\n$ obama_therm &lt;dbl&gt; 15, 100, 70, 30, 70, 45, 50, 60, 15, 100, NA, 0, 45, 30, 4…\n$ dem         &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ gender      &lt;fct&gt; Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male…\n\n\nLet’s take a random sample of 1,000 people from this biased sample of our population and estimate the relationship between their feelings towards Obama and their party affiliation.\n\nnes_1000_men &lt;- sample_n(nes_men, 1000)\n\nm &lt;- lm(obama_therm ~ dem, data = nes_1000_men)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             coef_rename = c(dem = \"Democrat\"), \n             statistic = \"conf.int\", \n             stars = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n43.575***\n\n\n\n[41.303, 45.847]\n\n\nDemocrat\n41.641***\n\n\n\n[37.722, 45.559]\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n925\n\n\nR2\n0.320\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.320\n\n\nAIC\n8838.3\n\n\nBIC\n8852.8\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−4416.169\n\n\nF\n435.015\n\n\nRMSE\n28.65\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur estimate is consistent: we demonstrated above that a 1,000 person sample is large enough to give us confidence that this single sample’s coefficient is probably close to the average we would draw from an infinite number of random samples of our population.\nBut, I am not necessarily confident that this estimate is close to the true coefficient. That’s because we have a biased sample. We are interested in learning what the relationship is between individuals’ feelings towards Obama and their political affiliation across the whole US voting population. But we have only used information on people who identified as male to learn about that relationship.\nTo illustrate, here is the estimate produced by a 1,000 people random sample of the whole pool of respondents:\n\nnes_1000 &lt;- sample_n(nes, 1000)\n\nm &lt;- lm(obama_therm ~ dem, data = nes_1000)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             coef_rename = c(dem = \"Democrat\"), \n             statistic = \"conf.int\", \n             stars = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n43.102***\n\n\n\n[40.732, 45.473]\n\n\nDemocrat\n41.505***\n\n\n\n[37.724, 45.287]\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n934\n\n\nR2\n0.332\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.332\n\n\nAIC\n8929.3\n\n\nBIC\n8943.8\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−4461.647\n\n\nF\n463.948\n\n\nRMSE\n28.73\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we include people who do not identify as male in our population from which we draw our random sample, we get a smaller estimate of the association between an individual’s feelings towards Obama and their party affiliation.\nOur coefficient estimate was artificially high because of our biased sample. This could meaningfully effect our understanding of the substantive significance of party affiliation on feelings towards Obama."

    "text": "Heteroscedasticity\nOne of the things you need to assume is true when you use linear regression to learn about the relationship between your outcome of interest and predictors is that your random error varies consistently across all values of your predictors.\nTo illustrate, let’s return to our made up model from last week.\n\\[\nY = 10 + 20X_1 + \\epsilon\n\\]\nRemember, that \\(y_i\\) will rarely equal exactly \\(10 + 20x_i\\). There will always be a little random error, \\(\\epsilon\\), sprinkled in there. If all is going well, this random error is independent of \\(X\\). In other words, you don’t need to know what the value of \\(x_i\\) is to work out what the random error is.\nLet’s find \\(Y\\) in a world in which our error is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 50.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember, this means we are just randomly drawing a value from this distribution and adding it to \\(10+20x_1i\\) to find \\(y_i\\):\n\nggplot(tibble(error = rnorm(1e6, mean = 0, sd = 50)), aes(x = error)) + \n  geom_density(fill = \"#A2E3C4\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nerror &lt;- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 50)\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(\n  x = 1:100,\n  error = error, \n  y = 10 + 20*x + error\n)\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 100 × 3\n       x error     y\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 -15.6  14.4\n 2     2 -38.9  11.1\n 3     3  36.3 106. \n 4     4  22.9 113. \n 5     5  57.8 168. \n 6     6 -28.4 102. \n 7     7 -46.1 104. \n 8     8 -35.3 135. \n 9     9 -50.3 140. \n10    10  25.0 235. \n# ℹ 90 more rows\n\n\nFor any given value of \\(x_i\\), the random error has an equal chance of being any normally distributed value with a standard error of 50. In other words, 95 percent of the time, the random error is going to be some value between -98 and 98 (or \\(1.96*50\\), remember back to confidence intervals).\nWe can plot this to get a better look at what consistent variation in the error term looks like:\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + \n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 10 + 20*x - 95, ymax = 10 + 20*x + 95),\n              fill = \"grey\", alpha = 0.75) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nWhen this is the case, we have homoscedasticity.\nWhat happens if the variance in the error term changes across \\(x_i\\)?\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(x = 1:100) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(error = rnorm(1, sd = x*3),\n         y = 10 + 20*x + error)\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 100 × 3\n# Rowwise: \n       x  error     y\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1   3.03  33.0\n 2     2 -19.9   30.1\n 3     3  -1.46  68.5\n 4     4 -14.6   75.4\n 5     5   2.35 112. \n 6     6 -16.1  114. \n 7     7  20.2  170. \n 8     8   3.91 174. \n 9     9 -14.4  176. \n10    10 -19.8  190. \n# ℹ 90 more rows\n\n\nHere, our error term is not independent of \\(X\\). We need to know \\(x_i\\) before we can work out the error value. Here, it is a random value drawn from a normal distribution that has a standard deviation equal to three times the given value of \\(x_i\\).\nLet’s visualize that:\n\ndf |&gt;\n  mutate(ymin = 10 + 20*x - x * 3 * 1.96,\n         ymax = 10 + 20*x + x * 3 * 1.96) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax)) + \n  geom_ribbon(fill = \"grey\", alpha = 0.75) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have heteroscadasticity. When this is the case, we will have biased standard errors on our coefficient estimates. We cannot tell which way this bias will lean: we could be over or underestimating our confidence in our estimates."

    "section": "Regression models",
    "text": "Regression models\nThis week we are going to continue to look at how we can model the distribution of our outcome of interest using a single predictor.\nHere’s the general formula for a linear regression model with a single predictor:\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\epsilon\n\\]\nLet’s work backwards to help build our intuition for this model. Let’s start with a modeled relationship between some outcome, \\(Y\\), and a predictor, \\(X_1\\):\n\\[\nY = 10 + 20X_1 + \\epsilon\n\\]\nThink of this as the true relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOut there in the real world we use modeling to attempt to find this true relationship. If only we had access to it!\n\n\n\nRandom error\nThis equation has two unknown variables: \\(X_1\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\). You need both to be able to calculate the corresponding values for \\(Y\\).\n\\(X_1\\) will in many ways be more intuitive for you. Generally, it represents some vector of values that representing something tangible: perhaps it’s a person’s age, a country’s GDP, or a binary value telling you whether or not a country is a democracy. The error term can be a bit more abstract, so let’s take a minute to look at it more closely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA quick note on notation! Generally, we will use capital letters (for example, \\(Y\\) and \\(X_1\\)) to denote vectors and lower case letters (for example, \\(y\\) and \\(x_1\\)) to denote single values (usually with another subscript telling us the observation to which that single value belongs).\nWhat is a vector? Here, I mean a series of values. In other words, it is a fancy term for some variable. The term comes from matrix algebra. A matrix with only one row or column is referred to as a vector. Think of it simply as one column (variable) or one row (unit of observation) of a dataframe.\nFor example, if our outcome of interest is whether or not an individual will vote in the next election, we might use data on whether or not survey respondents voted in the last election to study the predictors of voting. In this case, our vector \\(Y\\) will be a series of 1s and 0s describing whether or not each survey respondent voted in the last election.\n\n\nThe error term; on the other hand, is a set of random values. It captures all of the random things that inevitably muddy the relationship between our outcomes of interest and our predictors in the real world.\nWe can learn some useful things about the random error effecting our outcome of interest. For example, let’s say that the error in this true relationship is normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 50. In other words, there is some random noise in our data: \\(Y\\) does not always precisely equal \\(10 + 20X_1\\). Some random value will always be added to \\(10 + 20X_1\\). That value will be drawn randomly from this distribution:\n\nggplot(tibble(error = rnorm(1e6, mean = 0, sd = 50)), aes(x = error)) + \n  geom_density(fill = \"#A2E3C4\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThe coloured area under that curve represents the probability that the corresponding error value (along the \\(x\\)-axis) will be drawn. This means that each error value randomly drawn is most likely to be a number around zero (where the curve peaks). It is very unlikely to be a number bigger than around 150 or smaller than around -150.\nNotably, this error value is completely independent of \\(X_1\\) and \\(Y\\) (you don’t need these values to work out your error value). To demonstrate, let’s draw some of those random error values from this distribution:\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 50)\n\n[1] -47.37963\n\n\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 50)\n\n[1] -84.53445\n\n\n\nrnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 50)\n\n[1] -28.83643\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis semester we will talk a lot about the assumptions you are required to make when you fit a linear regression model. These include some assumptions about error, including its shape and uniformity."

Let’s take a look at those plausible alternatives to see whether the true relationship (\\(\\beta_0 = 10\\) and \\(\\beta_1 = 20\\)) is sitting in there.\nLet’s start with the intercept. Centering our plausible set of intercept estimates on our model’s best guess - 8.09 - let’s simulate those alternative estimates using our uncertainty (the intercept coefficient’s standard error) and see where the “true” intercept estimate (represented by the black line on the graph below) sits within this context:\n\nintercept_est &lt;- tidy(m) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; \n  pull(estimate)\n\nintercept_est\n\n[1] 8.091687\n\nintercept_se &lt;- tidy(m) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"(Intercept)\") |&gt; \n  pull(std.error)\n\nintercept_se\n\n[1] 9.976851\n\n\n\ntibble(intercept = rnorm(1e6, mean = intercept_est, sd = intercept_se)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = intercept)) + \n  stat_halfeye(.width = c(0.025, 0.975), fill = \"#A2E3C4\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 10) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI expect these plausible alternative coefficients to be normally distributed. For a simulated proof of why we can assume this, please check out the Regression notes from GVPT622.\n\n\nWe can do the same for our model’s best guess of \\(\\beta_1\\):\n\nbeta_1_est &lt;- tidy(m) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"x_1\") |&gt; \n  pull(estimate)\n\nbeta_1_est\n\n[1] 20.08444\n\nbeta_1_se &lt;- tidy(m) |&gt; \n  filter(term == \"x_1\") |&gt; \n  pull(std.error)\n\nbeta_1_se\n\n[1] 0.1715183\n\n\n\ntibble(beta_1 = rnorm(1e6, mean = beta_1_est, sd = beta_1_se)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = beta_1)) + \n  stat_halfeye(.width = c(0.025, 0.975), fill = \"#3095A2\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 20) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nOften in political science we are required to accept that the true estimates sit somewhere with 95 percent of these alternatives.

Sometimes you will theorize that changes to a predictor are associated with changes to your outcome of interest. Sometimes the truth is that there is no meaningful relationship between the two. We can learn a lot from strong null results. You should always aim to reduce your uncertainty, even if it leads to a stronger zero."

    "text": "Interpreting your regression models\nWe use regression models to provide empirical evidence of the relationship between our outcome of interest and a set of predictors that we theorize to be important drivers of that outcome.\nRegression models cannot prove causality. This can make them difficult or awkward to interpret. You need to be very careful with the language you use to describe your model to avoid being misleading.\nLet’s step through interpreting your model results. To do this, we will look at the (highly precise) relationship between an individual’s feelings towards President Obama and their dog ownership.\nThe National Election Survey (NES) asked respondents both their feelings towards President Obama (rating between zero and 100, with higher values indicating more support) and whether or not they own a dog. Let’s fit a linear regression model against their responses to these two questions:\n\nm &lt;- lm(obama_therm ~ own_dog, data = nes)\n\nmodelsummary(m,\n             statistic = \"[{conf.low}, {conf.high}]\",\n             stars = T,\n             coef_rename = c(\"own_dogYes\" = \"Owns a dog\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n74.305***\n\n\n\n[72.505, 76.104]\n\n\nOwns a dog\n−9.286***\n\n\n\n[−12.005, −6.566]\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n1927\n\n\nR2\n0.023\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.022\n\n\nAIC\n18606.2\n\n\nBIC\n18622.8\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−9300.077\n\n\nRMSE\n30.18\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur regression model is as follows:\n\\[\nObama\\ thermometer = 74.3047 - 9.2858*Owns\\ a\\ dog + \\epsilon\n\\]\nIt is tempting to state that the estimated effect of dog ownership on an individual’s feelings towards Obama is a decrease of 9.28 points, on average and holding all else constant. However, this suggests an effect for which we really have no proof. According to Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020), an effect is usually thought of as “the change associated with some treatment, or intervention” (pg. 84). Here, we would be suggesting that if we gave someone a dog, their support for Obama would drop by 9.28 points. That’s not actually what we have found. Rather, we have observed that, on average, people who were surveyed who had a dog had lower opinions of Obama than those who did not own a dog.\nAnother way of thinking about this is to acknowledge that regression models using observational data only allow us to make comparisons between our units of observation. Here, we can make comparisons between respondents to the NES. We cannot, however, use this model to make statements about changes to any individual respondent. The NES did not give someone a dog and then ask them how their feelings towards Obama changed. We cannot suggest that we have insight into the effects of such an intervention (as cute as it would be).\nWhen you are interpreting a regression model, you should use comparative language. For example, we can say that, under the fitted model, the average difference in feelings towards President Obama between a person with a dog and a person without a dog is 9.28 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis care with your language will become even more important when we move on to looking at multiple predictors.\n\n\nRemember: regression is just fancy averaging. This binary predictor makes this point easy to illustrate. For example, let’s look at how we can interpret the intercept. Individuals who do not own a dog (own_dog \\(= 0\\)) are predicted to report feeling 74.3 points towards President Obama, on average and holding all else constant.\nWhere did this come from, you may ask? It’s just fancy averaging!\n\navg_responses &lt;- nes |&gt; \n  drop_na(own_dog) |&gt; \n  group_by(own_dog) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_obama_therm = mean(obama_therm, na.rm = T))\n\navg_responses\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  own_dog avg_obama_therm\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No                 74.3\n2 Yes                65.0\n\n\nThere it is! It’s just the average response provided by those who do not own a dog. How cool is that?!\nYou may also have noticed that the difference between the average response provided by dog owners and non-dog owners is roughly 9 points. Hmm…\n\nmutate(avg_responses, diff = avg_obama_therm - lag(avg_obama_therm))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  own_dog avg_obama_therm  diff\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No                 74.3 NA   \n2 Yes                65.0 -9.29\n\n\nThat’s our coefficient estimate! It’s just the difference in the average response provided by dog owners and non-dog owners.\nThis is the beauty of linear regression: we can gain so much insight into the important predictors of the things that we really care about by applying simple and clear statistical processes to our data."

    "text": "Making predictions using your regression model\nThis leads us neatly to another great use for our regression model: predictions. We can use our model to predict our outcome of interest.\nFor example, imagine that I pulled someone randomly from the US voting population and asked them their feelings towards President Obama on a 100-point scale. What would be your best guess of their response?\nWe have access to the NES, which is a representative sample of the US voting population. In other words, they pulled 5,916 people randomly from the US voting population and asked them this very question. We can look at the first 10 respondents’ answers:\n\nhead(nes$obama_therm, n = 10)\n\n [1]  15 100  70  30  70  45  50  60  15 100\n\n\nImagine that the only information I provide to you is these 5,916 individuals’ responses. Your educated best guess may then be the average of their response:\n\nmean(nes$obama_therm, na.rm = T)\n\n[1] 60.74377\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s just fancy averaging!\n\nlm(obama_therm ~ 1, data = nes)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = obama_therm ~ 1, data = nes)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)  \n      60.74  \n\n\n\n\n\nNow I might ask you what other piece of information you would like to know about this random individual that might improve your guess. You may respond that you would like to know whether or not the random individual identifies as a Democrat. You suspect that Democrats will have warmer feelings towards Obama than non-Democrats.\nYou adopt the same approach (your best guess is the average response), but you can now look at Democrats and non-Democrats separately.\n\nobama_therm_dem &lt;- nes |&gt; \n  group_by(dem) |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_obama_therm = mean(obama_therm, na.rm = T))\n\nobama_therm_dem\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n    dem avg_obama_therm\n  &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0            44.2\n2     1            85.3\n3    NA            65.7\n\n\nNow your best guess may be 85.31 if the random person identifies as a Democrat and 44.24 if they do not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s just fancy averaging!\n\nlm(obama_therm ~ dem, data = nes)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = obama_therm ~ dem, data = nes)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          dem  \n      44.24        41.06  \n\n\nRemember, the coefficient estimate for dem is the estimated difference between individuals who do not identify as Democrats (dem \\(= 0\\)) and individuals who identify as Democrats (dem \\(= 1\\)). In other words, add those two values together and you will get the average response provided by Democrats.\n\n\n\nHave you improved your guess? How might we evaluate this? One approach would be to look at how far our predicted values were from the observed values.\nUsing our most simple approach, we will always predict the average feeling thermometer value provided by respondents to the NES. Using our slightly more sophisticated approach, we will predict the average response provided by Democrats if the individual is a Democrat, or the average response provided by non-Democrats if they do not identify as a Democrat. Let’s map those predictions against the actual responses provided by NES participants:\n\npred &lt;- nes |&gt; \n  transmute(dem, \n            obama_therm,\n            pred_simple = mean(nes$obama_therm, na.rm = T)) |&gt; \n  left_join(obama_therm_dem) |&gt; \n  rename(pred_party_id = avg_obama_therm)\n\npred |&gt; \n  select(dem, obama_therm, pred_simple, pred_party_id) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n  dem obama_therm pred_simple pred_party_id\n1   0          15    60.74377      44.24474\n2   1         100    60.74377      85.30587\n3   0          70    60.74377      44.24474\n4   1          30    60.74377      85.30587\n5   0          70    60.74377      44.24474\n6   0          45    60.74377      44.24474\n\n\nHere, we have stored our simple prediction in the pred_simple variable and our approach that accounts for party identification in the pred_party_id column.\nHow does each approach perform?\n\npred |&gt; \n  mutate(resid_simple = pred_simple - obama_therm,\n         resid_party_id = pred_party_id - obama_therm) |&gt; \n  summarise(r_2_simple = sum(resid_simple^2, na.rm = T),\n            r_2_party_id = sum(resid_party_id^2, na.rm = T))\n\n  r_2_simple r_2_party_id\n1    6582137      4364116\n\n\nThe simple approach predicts values further from the observed values than our approach that accounts for party ID. Great! It is worthwhile asking our random individual to which party they belong.\nSoon, we will look at including more than one predictor in our models. This will help us improve our predictive power even further."

    "text": "The economic benefits of justice\nAppel and Loyle (2012) (two wonderful UMD alumni) explore the determinants of foreign direct investment (FDI) flows into and out of post-conflict states. States that are emerging from civil war often have an acute need for foreign and stable sources of capital. However, multinational corporations and other foreign commercial actors are likely to view post-conflict states as high risk countries in which to invest: the risk of a return to violence and instability is often high in the immediate aftermath of a civil war. Understanding this, leaders of post-conflict states often attempt to decrease this perceived risk.\nAppel and Loyle argue that leaders can successfully do this by establishing post-conflict justice (PCJ) institutions. These institutions impose both domestic and reputational costs on post-conflict leaders. These costs allow leaders to signal their commitment to minimizing the risk of a return to violence and instability to foreign commercial actors. This is a great paper and I highly encourage you to take a look at their argument in detail.\nTheir argument focuses on leaders’ attempts to change foreign commercial actors’ perceptions of the risk of a return to violence. We cannot directly observe these commercial actors’ perceptions. However, we can observe the outcome of these perceptions: investment. If Appel and Loyle’s argument is correct, we should observe higher levels of FDI investment coming into post-conflict states that establish PCJ institutions compared to those that do not, on average and holding all else constant.\nAppel and Loyle find strong evidence of this. We will replicate and modify this empirical work. In doing so, we will become more familiar with the underlying mechanics of multiple linear regression and strengthen our ability to interpret these models.\nLet’s get started!"

This is the period in which we would expect foreign commercial actors to perceive the risk of a return to violence and instability to be greatest and; therefore, the period in which leaders’ attempts to quash these perceptions to be most relevant.\nTherefore, each row in this data set represents a single post-conflict state. The data is generally a summary of the 10-years post-conflict. For example net_fdi_inflows provides us with the total net FDI inflows each post-conflict state received in that 10-year period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can learn more about each variable using the following command:\n\n?ebj\n\n\n\nTheir outcome of interest is net FDI inflows. Remember, if their argument is correct we would expect post-conflict states that have established a PCJ institution to have higher net FDI inflows than than states that did not. Let’s take a look at those net inflows:\n\nsummary(ebj$net_fdi_inflows)\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. \n-1858.914    -0.572    38.290   759.146   408.250 24836.787 \n\n\n\nggplot(ebj, aes(x = net_fdi_inflows)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a clear outlier: a net FDI inflow of $24,836.79 million for Russia. You can see that this is pulling up the average net FDI inflows well above the median inflow across our group of post-conflict states. We will keep this in because this is not the focus of today’s session, but I would encourage you to explore whether these findings are sensitive to its inclusion.\n\n\nWe learn from this that some states have greater FDI outflows than inflows (resulting in negative net FDI inflows). Indonesia had the greatest negative inflow, with net inflows of -$1,858.91 million.\nOther states received greater foreign investments than they invested elsewhere, resulting in positive net FDI inflows. In fact, on average, post-conflict states received more inflows than outflows."

These countries are recovering from conflict: their economies are really weak. Leaders are often very keen to find stable and reliable sources of funding to promote and strengthen their battered economies. This average difference of $1,763.52 million is; therefore, likely to incentivize this policy.\nFurther, if we look at the range of plausible values of the coefficient on the existence of a PCJ institution (i.e. the confidence interval) we can see states that did not establish a commission plausibly receive no net FDI inflows in this post-conflict period. In fact, it is plausible that investment leaves their economies: this net inflow can be negative. On the other hand, states that do establish a commission enjoy, on average, billions in net FDI inflows. For an economy struggling to establish indigenous production in a post-conflict setting, this can be critical to their long-term economic development. Again, this is further proof of the substantive significance of this relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nVisualizing the full range of plausible coefficients can be a great way to communicate your findings:\n\nplot_predictions(m, condition = \"pcj\") + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"grey\") + \n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = \"Net FDI inflows (USD million)\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + \n  theme_minimal()"

    "text": "But what about other factors that shape net FDI inflows?\nOne of Appel and Loyle’s major contributions is their critique of approaches to estimating net FDI inflows that focus only on economic factors. They argue that there are several political factors that are significant determinants of other countries’ and foreign firms’ willingness to invest in these war-torn countries.\nThis critique is very valid, but it suggests that there are many different things influencing this outcome of interest, including economic factors. We have only looked at the political! The economists might turn around and accuse us of doing the very thing Appel and Loyle accused them of!\nLet’s add some of those economic factors into our model. We will start with an intuitive one: individuals’ economic wealth (measured as GDP per capita). I expect that foreign firms will be more willing to invest larger sums of money into economies with richer citizens. These citizens will be more willing and able to purchase the goods and services provided by those firms.\nTherefore, I hypothesize that the greater a state’s GDP per capita, the larger its net FDI inflows. I expect this to be the case regardless of whether the state has established a PCJ institution. Let’s test this claim:\n\nm &lt;- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + gdp_per_capita, data = ebj)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             coef_rename = c(\"pcjPCJ institutions\" = \"PCJ institutions established\",\n                             \"gdp_per_capita\" = \"GDP per capita (current USD)\"),\n             stars = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n−319.173\n\n\n\n(396.052)\n\n\nPCJ institutions established\n1673.288*\n\n\n\n(714.015)\n\n\nGDP per capita (current USD)\n0.318**\n\n\n\n(0.105)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n95\n\n\nR2\n0.142\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.124\n\n\nAIC\n1777.5\n\n\nBIC\n1787.7\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−884.742\n\n\nF\n7.638\n\n\nRMSE\n2681.52\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to find a positive and statistically significant relationship between net FDI inflows and the establishment of a PCJ institution. This model also accounts for the association between the state’s GDP per capita and those inflows.\nThe intercept here is not informative on its own. It tells us the estimated average net FDI inflows for states that do not have PCJ institutions and in which citizens had a GDP per capita of $0. Although the majority of states did not establish an institution, there are no states in the world that have a GDP per capita of $0.\nLet’s instead focus on the other coefficients. We find that states that established a PCJ institution received, on average, net FDI inflows of $1,673.29 million more than states that did not in the 10-year period after conflict. This is a slightly smaller estimated difference than we found in the model that did not account for individuals’ average wealth, but it remains large.\nWe also find that an increase in the GDP per capita of a state of $1,000 is associated with an increase of $318.45 million in net FDI inflow. This is consistent with our expectations that, holding all else constant, a country with a richer population is a more attractive investment destination than a country that has poorer citizens.\n\nUsing this richer model\nWe now have a richer understanding of the determinants of net FDI inflows to post-conflict countries. We have accounted for both economic and political determinants of those flows. Although it is often useful to look at the estimated relationship of each of those variables individually (as we did just above), we often learn more by looking at the whole model in context.\nAs usual, one of the easiest ways to communicate this is through a visualization. Let’s look at the predicted net FDI inflows for post-conflict countries that established and did not establish PCJ institutions across a range of plausible GDP per capita values:\n\nplot_predictions(m, condition = c(\"gdp_per_capita\", \"pcj\")) + \n  labs(x = \"GDP per capita (USD)\",\n       y = \"Net FDI inflows (USD million)\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the positive relationship between GDP per capita and net FDI inflows and that across any given value of GDP per capita states that have established a PCJ institution start and stay at a higher predicted inflow compared to those that did not.\n\n\nThe full model\nAppel and Loyle control for many more economic and political factors shaping net FDI inflows. Remember, they are arguing that the extensive literature that looks at the determinants of FDI flows to post-conflict states failed to account for this important political factor. However, that same literature did a very good job of identifying the economic factors, including countries’ economic development, size, and growth rates, that shape this outcome. They don’t dispute that these factors are also important, they just argue that we should also think about the role PCJ institutions play in shaping foreign firms’ beliefs about the risk of returning to violence.\nSo, let’s account for these other factors:\n\nm &lt;- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + gdp_per_capita + gdp + gdp_per_capita_growth + \n          cap_account_openness + ex_rate_fluc + labor + f_life_exp + \n          pol_constraints + polity2 + damage + conflict_duration + peace_agreement + \n          victory + cold_war, \n        data = ebj)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             coef_rename = c(\"pcjPCJ institutions\" = \"PCJ institutions established\",\n                             \"gdp_per_capita\" = \"GDP per capita (current USD)\",\n                             \"gdp\" = \"GDP (current USD)\",\n                             \"gdp_per_capita_growth\" = \"GDP per capita growth rate (%)\",\n                             \"cap_account_openness\" = \"Capital account openness\",\n                             \"ex_rate_fluc\" = \"Exchange rate fluctuation\",\n                             \"labor\" = \"Labor force participation (%)\",\n                             \"f_life_exp\" = \"Average female life expectancy (years)\",\n                             \"pol_constraints\" = \"Political constraints\",\n                             \"polity2\" = \"Regime type (Polity score)\",\n                             \"damage\" = \"Pre-conflict GDP lost\",\n                             \"conflict_duration\" = \"Conflict duration (years)\",\n                             \"peace_agreementPeace agreement\" = \"Peace agreement\",\n                             \"victoryVictory\" = \"Decisive victory\",\n                             \"cold_warCold War\" = \"Cold War\"),\n             stars = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n−1278.322\n\n\n\n(2852.294)\n\n\nPCJ institutions established\n1960.282**\n\n\n\n(702.992)\n\n\nGDP per capita (current USD)\n−0.111\n\n\n\n(0.133)\n\n\nGDP (current USD)\n0.000***\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\nGDP per capita growth rate (%)\n37.400\n\n\n\n(23.239)\n\n\nCapital account openness\n198.823\n\n\n\n(201.590)\n\n\nExchange rate fluctuation\n−42.516**\n\n\n\n(13.888)\n\n\nLabor force participation (%)\n9.844\n\n\n\n(25.528)\n\n\nAverage female life expectancy (years)\n3.475\n\n\n\n(32.993)\n\n\nPolitical constraints\n2557.954+\n\n\n\n(1459.599)\n\n\nRegime type (Polity score)\n−90.169\n\n\n\n(56.309)\n\n\nPre-conflict GDP lost\n28.379**\n\n\n\n(10.242)\n\n\nConflict duration (years)\n0.811\n\n\n\n(35.543)\n\n\nPeace agreement\n−1215.137\n\n\n\n(793.826)\n\n\nDecisive victory\n−33.969\n\n\n\n(650.725)\n\n\nCold War\n81.531\n\n\n\n(654.092)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n95\n\n\nR2\n0.514\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.422\n\n\nAIC\n1749.5\n\n\nBIC\n1792.9\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−857.752\n\n\nRMSE\n2018.34\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven when we account for all the political, economic, and conflict-related factors that the literature previously identified to be important, we still find that the existence of PCJ institution substantively and statistically significantly shapes the net FDI inflows of post-conflict states."

    "section": "Including categorical variables with multiple categories",
    "text": "Including categorical variables with multiple categories\nAppel and Loyle look at a number of political factors driving net FDI inflows to post-conflict states. They include a measure of regime type: the country’s Polity score. This score measures a state’s regime type along a 21-point scale from -10 (perfect autocracy) to 10 (perfect democracy). Broadly speaking, political scientists have usefully broken this spectrum down into three regime types: democracies, hybrid regimes, and autocracies.\nLet’s modify their measure of regime type to reflect these broad categories, instead of treating it as a continuous variable:\n\nebj &lt;- ebj |&gt; \n  mutate(regime_type = case_when(polity2 &gt; 5 ~ \"Democracy\",\n                                 polity2 &lt; -5 ~ \"Autocracy\",\n                                 TRUE ~ \"Hybrid regime\"),\n         regime_type = factor(regime_type, levels = c(\"Autocracy\",\n                                                      \"Hybrid regime\",\n                                                      \"Democracy\")))\n\nI have a theoretical reason to do this. I suspect that there is not a clear linear relationship between investors’ confidence in a post-conflict state and its regime type when we treat regime type as a continuous spectrum moving linearly from autocracies to democracies. In other words, I don’t think that moving one Polity score away from being an autocracy to being a democracy would have a consistent effect on investor confidence (and; therefore, net FDI inflows). Appel and Loyle’s model agrees with me: the regime type variable is not statistically significant.\nRather, I suspect that strong democracies and strong autocracies provide the political stability required to comfort foreign investors. These investors believe that the strong control democrats and autocrats have over their citizens and institutions reduces the risk that the country will re-enter into conflict. However, hybrid regimes do not tend to have this level of control. Investors are; therefore, less likely to invest in post-conflict countries with hybrid regimes.\nLet’s test this!\nWe now have a categorical variable with three categories: democracy, hybrid regime, and autocracy. We have thus far largely dealt with binary categorical variables (voted or not, Southern or not, female or not). How do we use and interpret multiple categorical variables in regression analysis?\nHappily, the intuition remains the same as with our binary categorical variables. We hold one category out as our baseline category and then compare the associated effects of the other categories to this one.\nLet’s step through that using a stripped back version of our model:\n\nm &lt;- lm(net_fdi_inflows ~ pcj + regime_type, data = ebj)\n\nmodelsummary(m, \n             coef_rename = c(\"pcjPCJ institutions\" = \"PCJ institutions established\",\n                             \"regime_typeDemocracy\" = \"Democracy\",\n                             \"regime_typeHybrid regime\" = \"Hybrid\"),\n             stars = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n214.555\n\n\n\n(497.984)\n\n\nPCJ institutions established\n1816.169*\n\n\n\n(764.093)\n\n\nHybrid\n553.893\n\n\n\n(667.644)\n\n\nDemocracy\n−148.124\n\n\n\n(809.623)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n95\n\n\nR2\n0.068\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.037\n\n\nAIC\n1787.4\n\n\nBIC\n1800.1\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−888.688\n\n\nF\n2.217\n\n\nRMSE\n2795.25\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll note that autocracies are missing from our regression table. This is because they are being held out as our baseline category. Their effect on net FDI inflows is captured by the intercept coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe often say that the intercept coefficient represents the predicted average value of our outcome of interest when all independent variables are set to zero. It might be useful for you to think of your baseline category as taking on the value zero. For example, we can think of autocracy = 0.\n\n\nOur model suggests that autocracies (regime_type = \"Autocracy\") that have not established a commission (pcj = \"No institutions\") have a predicted average net FDI inflow of $214.55 million.\nThe coefficients on democracies and hybrid regimes need to be interpreted in relation to autocracies (their baseline category). From our model, we can see that the coefficient for democracies is negative and the coefficient for hybrid regimes is positive. That means that, on average, democracies tend to receive less net FDI inflows than autocracies and hybrid regimes tend to receive more net FDI inflows than autocracies.\n\nPredictions with multiple categorical variables\nUsing our model, what do we predict to be the net FDI inflows for democracies, autocracies, and hybrid regimes that either have a PCJ institutions or do not?\nFirst, let’s create a table with each possible combination of these two variables of interest:\n\nnew_data &lt;- tibble(pcj = factor(c(\"No institutions\", \n                                  \"PCJ institutions\"))) |&gt; \n  cross_join(\n    tibble(regime_type = factor(c(\"Autocracy\", \"Democracy\", \"Hybrid regime\")))\n  )\n\nnew_data\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  pcj              regime_type  \n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;fct&gt;        \n1 No institutions  Autocracy    \n2 No institutions  Democracy    \n3 No institutions  Hybrid regime\n4 PCJ institutions Autocracy    \n5 PCJ institutions Democracy    \n6 PCJ institutions Hybrid regime\n\n\nThen we can use our model to predict what we expect a hypothetical state with each of these combinations of characteristics to receive in net FDI inflows:\n\npred &lt;- augment(m, newdata = new_data)\n\npred\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  pcj              regime_type   .fitted\n  &lt;fct&gt;            &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No institutions  Autocracy       215. \n2 No institutions  Democracy        66.4\n3 No institutions  Hybrid regime   768. \n4 PCJ institutions Autocracy      2031. \n5 PCJ institutions Democracy      1883. \n6 PCJ institutions Hybrid regime  2585. \n\n\nThat’s a bit unweildy. Let’s visualize it!\n\nggplot(pred, aes(x = .fitted, y = pcj, colour = regime_type)) + \n  geom_point(size = 5) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Predicted net FDI inflows (USD, million)\",\n       y = NULL, \n       colour = \"Regime type\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see that states that established PCJ institutions received, on average, larger net FDI inflows than states that did not, no matter their regime type. Further and completely counter to my hypothesis, hybrid regimes have, on average, the highest net FDI inflows compared to democracies and autocracies even when we account for whether the state has a PCJ institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI’m not too worried: none of these coefficients are anywhere close to being statistically significant. I suspect that there is a more complex relationship underlying commercial actors’ beliefs about the stability of hybrid regimes, democracies, and autocracies and its effect on net investment flows. But I hope this serves as a good illustration of how we can use multiple categorical variables in our analyses."

    "text": "Do richer countries enjoy better health outcomes?\nLet’s return to a familiar question: what is the relationship between a country’s health and its wealth?\nHere, our outcome of interest is the average health of countries’ citizens. We want to determine what factors are important determinants of a country’s citizens’ health. We theorize that the level of wealth each country’s citizens hold is an important determinant of their overall health.\nSimply put, our goal is to produce the best model we can of how our outcome of interest occurs. You might hear people refer to this process - how an outcome of interest occurs - as the data generation process. This is just a rather sterile way of asking how our outcome of interest comes to be. For example, what factors drove the level of health of countries last year? How did they shape those health outcomes?\nWe can use a good model of our outcome of interest to achieve two worthwhile goals. First, this model provides us with explanatory traction. This, generally speaking, is your raison d’être as an academic. Your research goals should be to identify and explain the mechanisms driving changes to some important outcome of interest. To do that, you need to identify what factors are the important determinants of that outcome of interest. What gets people out to vote? What drives countries to war with one another? Why do some countries experience democratic backsliding? You need to find and then explain what factors are the most important drivers of these outcomes. You can use these statistical tools to do just that.\nSecond, this model provides us with predictive power. If we know the factors that are driving (or at least strongly associated with) changes to our outcome of interest and we know how they are shaping that outcome, we can predict how changes to those factors will effect our outcome of interest. For example, if you know that large spikes in the price of food staples are strongly associated with the onset of civil unrest, you can alert policymakers to the increased risk of that unrest if such spikes occur. You can also use your model to inform policymakers of the expected effects of various policies or interventions that they may be considering.\nHaving completed GVPT622, you now have the knowledge and skills to test empirically the relationship between two variables: a dependent and an independent variable. Let’s refresh those."

We will use historical data to learn about the relationship between a country’s health and wealth. We will then extrapolate from that historical relationship to a generalized understanding of the relationship.\nTo do this, we need an observable and measurable factor that appropriately represents each of these concepts. I propose to follow the approach applied by the Gapminder project. We will use the average life expectancy of each country’s citizens as a measure of the health of its citizens. Countries with higher average life expectancy are assumed to have higher levels of health. We will use each country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as our proxy measure of its citizens’ average wealth. Countries with higher GDP per capita are assumed to have wealthier citizens.\nWe might expect that as the wealth of country’s citizens increases, so too does their overall health.

    "text": "Step 2: Know your data\nOnce you have data for your variables of interest you should take a good look at them. We now have access to data on 217 countries’ average life expectancy and GDP per capita.\n\nIndividual variables\nFirst, take a look at each variable individually. Some useful questions with which to start include:\n\nWhat kind of data are they (continuous or categorical)?\nHow are they distributed (normally or are they skewed)?\nAre there any unusual data points? If so, why are they unusual?\nAre any observations missing? Is this missingness random or systematic?\n\nOne of the easiest ways to answer these and other important questions is by visualizing your variables. We can use the many great plot functions in ggplot to do this.\nLet’s start with our outcome of interest: a country’s average life expectancy.\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = life_exp)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"Average life expectancy (in years)\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThis is what we are trying to model.\nWe suspect that the average wealth of a country’s citizens is associated with their overall level of health. Let’s look at the distribution of countries’ GDP per capita:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = gdp_per_cap)) + \n  geom_histogram() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(\n    x = \"GDP per capita (in current USD)\",\n    y = \"Count\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between these two variables\nNow you can take a look at the relationship between your two variables of interest.\nSome good questions with which to start:\n\nHow do the two variables move with each other? As one goes up, does the other also go up, go down, or stay roughly constant?\nWhat is the shape of this relationship? Is it constant (linear)?\nAre there any noticable clusters or groups of observations?\nAre there any unusual observations? Ones sitting out on their own?\n\nLet’s visualize the relationship between each country’s average life expectancy and its GDP per capita:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"GDP per capita (USD current)\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\nThis relationship is positive: as a country’s wealth increases, so too does its health. However, this relationship is not linear. An increase of $1,000 GDP per capita tends to be associated with a large increase in the country’s average life expectancy when the country has relatively low GDP per capita compared to the change in a richer country’s average life expectancy that tends to be associated with that same $1,000 increase in GDP per capita.\nWe can model non-linear relationships; however, these models can be difficult to interpret. Happily the relationship between a country’s average life expectancy and its logged GDP per capita is linear:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\nThis transformation means that we can now appropriately fit a linear model to these two variables: logged GDP per capita and average life expectancy."

A country with a logged GDP per capita of zero is expected to have an average life expectancy of 33.217 years, on average. This is not a very useful piece of information because there are no countries with zero (logged) GDP per capita. Therefore, this intercept coefficient is more usefully thought of as a statistical artifact that grounds our model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nLinear regression models cannot detect causal relationships.

As we step through this you should think critically about what questions you should ask of your data and your model that would help convince you that you have found the underlying relationship.\nThe first thing that is worth noting is that in the previous step we moved away from focusing on modelling our outcome of interest: each country’s average life expectancy. Instead, we wanted to understand the relationship between that outcome and our independent variable (each country’s GDP per capita). Let’s step back for a second and look again at modelling the outcome of interest.\nTo do this, we can see what our model predicts each country’s average life expectancy to be given its GDP per capita. To work this out, we simply need to plug each country’s GDP per capita into our model:\n\\[\nLife\\ expectancy = 33.427 + 4.316 Logged\\ GDP\\ per\\ capita + \\epsilon\n\\]\nHappily, broom::augment() does this for us:\n\nm_pred &lt;- augment(m)\nm_pred\n\n# A tibble: 201 × 9\n   .rownames life_exp log_gdp_per_cap .fitted .resid    .hat .sigma  .cooksd\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1             74.6           10.3     77.9 -3.24  0.00956   4.24 0.00285 \n 2 2             62.0            5.87    58.7  3.25  0.0255    4.24 0.00793 \n 3 3             61.6            7.56    66.1 -4.43  0.00887   4.23 0.00494 \n 4 4             76.5            8.76    71.3  5.20  0.00500   4.23 0.00380 \n 5 6             78.7           10.7     79.7 -0.978 0.0127    4.24 0.000348\n 6 7             75.4            9.27    73.5  1.90  0.00536   4.24 0.000542\n 7 8             72.0            8.51    70.2  1.86  0.00526   4.24 0.000511\n 8 10            78.5            9.75    75.6  2.93  0.00677   4.24 0.00164 \n 9 11            83.3           11.0     81.1  2.25  0.0156    4.24 0.00226 \n10 12            81.2           10.9     80.5  0.733 0.0144    4.24 0.000221\n# ℹ 191 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: .std.resid &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\naugment() takes each of our 217 countries’ logged GDP per capita (log_gdp_per_cap), plugs it into our model (written above), and tells us the corresponding predicted average life expectancy (.fitted).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that some data are missing for some countries. That is why we have less than 217 predicted values.\n\n\nLet’s take a look at both our predicted average life expectancy and the actual average life expectancy of each country in our dataset:\n\nggplot(m_pred) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = life_exp)) + \n  geom_histogram(aes(x = .fitted), fill = \"blue\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Average life expectancy (in years)\",\n       y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of the predicted average life expectancy is provided in blue.

Ultimately; however, we want to find a generalized relationship between our outcome of interest and the independent variable that we think is an important driver of that outcome. Rather than focusing on building a model that perfectly predicts the average life expectancy of countries given their GDP per capita in 2021, we want to learn something about the general shape of this relationship. A linear regression model helps us do this.\nTo illustrate, let’s go back to our model:\n\\[\nLife\\ expectancy = 33.427 + 4.316 Logged\\ GDP\\ per\\ capita + \\epsilon\n\\]\nLet’s plot out the predicted average life expectancy for hypothetical countries with any logged GDP per capita within a plausible range:\n\naugment(m, newdata = tibble(log_gdp_per_cap = seq(0, 12, by = 0.01))) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = .fitted)) + \n  geom_line() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita (in current USD)\",\n       y = \"Predicted average life expectancy (in years)\")\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have used historical data that describe the actual average life expectancy of countries globally and their actual GDP per capita to build our understanding of an important factor associated with the overall health of a country’s citizens. In doing this, we have gained explanatory traction: there is a strong, positive association between a country’s GDP per capita and its average life expectancy. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer average life expectancy. We have also gained predictive power: for any given (logged) GDP per capita, we can predict what that country’s average life expectancy would be. Further, we can predict the change in a country’s average life expectancy that may result from a change in its GDP per capita.\nAll of this knowledge that we have gained rests on the strength of our model. Have we included all of the important drivers of a country’s average life expectancy? Have we used the right models of the relationship between those variables and average life expectancy? How much confidence do we have in our model’s ability to explain these relationships and to use those inputs to predict average life expectancy?\nOLS regression is one approach to finding this generalized relationship. Remember, an OLS regression finds the straight line that minimizes the distance between itself and all of the data points. To illustrate, let’s look back at our fitted model within the context of the data points used to generate it:\n\nggplot(gapminder_df, aes(x = log_gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = F) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"Logged GDP per capita\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\n\n\n\n\nThis is a strong and clean relationship: I can clearly see that countries with higher logged GDP per capita tend to have longer average life expectancies. This is incorporated into our model, which formalizes this positive relationship.\nThere are many different ways we can think about error, but before you apply any more complicated statistical tests you should take a look at your model in the context of your data. This really is the best way to determine whether your model is capturing the underlying relationship between your variables.\n\nError for each data point\nAn OLS regression finds the straight line that minimizes the distance between itself and all of the data points. We can look at how far the predicted value produced by our model is from each data point. This distance is called the residual. As above, we can use broom::augment() to find it:\n\naugment(m) |&gt; \n  select(life_exp, .fitted, .resid)\n\n# A tibble: 201 × 3\n   life_exp .fitted .resid\n      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     74.6    77.9 -3.24 \n 2     62.0    58.7  3.25 \n 3     61.6    66.1 -4.43 \n 4     76.5    71.3  5.20 \n 5     78.7    79.7 -0.978\n 6     75.4    73.5  1.90 \n 7     72.0    70.2  1.86 \n 8     78.5    75.6  2.93 \n 9     83.3    81.1  2.25 \n10     81.2    80.5  0.733\n# ℹ 191 more rows\n\n\nLet’s plot those differences to make them easier to digest:\n\nggplot(augment(m), aes(x = .resid)) + \n  geom_density() + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nIf our model perfectly predicted each country’s life expectancy, we would see no difference between the predicted and observed values. There would just be a very tall straight line at zero on the graph above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is not necessarily the goal. Random error is fine: the world is a complicated and chaotic place. However, we can use these residuals to evaluate our model. For example, you may notice that residuals for certain countries or groupings of countries are larger than the rest. This may prompt you to re-examine your data collection process (perhaps something strange went on) or to include another variable in your model that captures these differences.\n\n\nOur model hasn’t predicted life expectancy perfectly. Although most predictions are within a couple of years of the country’s observed average life expectancy, there are some that are very different (up to 10 or 15 years!). Where the model has got it wrong, it has tended to overestimate life expectancy (note that the peak of the density curve sits above zero).\n\n\nModel-wide tools\nSometimes we need a measure of the model’s overall accuracy. Here, I will refer you back to our notes from GVPT622: Relationships Between Two Variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou should be familiar with these tests: your colleagues will refer to them and reviewers may look at them. However, there is increasing recognition among political scientists of their limits. You will be far better off asking specific and critical questions of your data and your models than you will be by relying on many of these tests, which can sometimes be misleading.\nFor example, most of these tests are sensitive to the quantity of data you use. If you throw an extraordinary amount of data into your models, you will likely get a very good looking F-statistic and T-statistic, even if you have not fully uncovered the underlying relationship in your data. Our access to and ability to use very large amounts of data is only increasing. Issues with some of these tests will become more acute."

If we were to pull a different pure random sample from our population we would get a different set of coefficients. That’s totally fine!

Does this include zero (or no relationship)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember, regression coefficients tell us the expected change in our dependent variable changes for each one-unit increase in our independent variable, on average. If there is no association between our variables, there will be no change in our dependent variable and our regression coefficient will be zero.\n\n\nMost of the time you will be required to demonstrate that at least 95 percent of these plausible alternative coefficients do not include zero to claim statistical significance. In the graph above, this 95 percent is provided by the bar at the bottom of the density curve.\nTo work out whether 95 percent of these plausible alternative coefficients include zero we need to calculate the probability that we would observe the coefficient we found (here \\(\\beta_1 =\\) 4.343) if it were actually equal to zero. This probability is referred to as the p-value. We calculate it by finding our coefficient’s T-statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe T-distribution is standard and centered at zero. We can transform our coefficient to its T-statistic and place it within this T-distribution to determine how likely we are to observe this or a more extreme value.\n\n\nbroom::tidy() provides both the T-statistic and p-value for our coefficients:\n\ntidy(m)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term            estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)        33.2      1.82       18.2 3.01e-44\n2 log_gdp_per_cap     4.34     0.203      21.4 1.67e-53\n\n\nThe coefficient we observed is statistically significant: there is a very, very, very small chance (far less than 5% certainly) we would be able to pull a perfect random sample from our population and fit this model if there truly was no relationship between a country’s average life expectancy and its GDP per capita."

However, it ignores the structure of the data: it does not account for regional- or country-specific trends buried within.

The model predicts the same average life expectancy for every country in every region, despite clear differences between them. For example, countries in North America have a much higher average life expectancy than countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It would be great if we could account for some of these differences. What if we could customize this starting point (the intercept) for each region?\n\nRegion-level intercepts\nLet’s ask our model to adjust its starting point to the average life expectancy in countries within the same region.

All regions other than South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa had a higher average life expectancy than East Asia and the Pacific in 2000. North America had the highest average life expectancy with 76.8 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember, the intercept represents the predicted average life expectancy when all of our variables are equal to zero. When we have a categorical variable, we hold one category out as a baseline. The coefficients on the other categories are the predicted average change in the outcome relative to this baseline category.\n\n\nLet’s look at how our model performs across our sample of countries:\n\naugment(m_region, newdata = full_df) |&gt; \n  filter(country %in% countries) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + \n  geom_point(aes(y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted)) + \n  ggh4x::facet_nested_wrap(~ region + country) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThis is better! You can see that the starting point for each country looks more realistic than the global average. It reflects the average across the region.\nHowever, we can improve on this. Each country within the same region shares a starting point, but there can be a lot of variance within a single region. For example, look at the difference between Djibouti and Egypt.\n\n\nCountry-level intercepts\nLet’s ask our model to adjust the starting point to reflect the average life expectancy for each country in 2000:\n\nm_country &lt;- lm(life_exp ~ year + country, data = full_df)\n\nI won’t print the regression table for obvious reasons…\nLet’s look at how our model performs after this adjustment:\n\naugment(m_country) |&gt; \n  filter(country %in% countries) |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    distinct(full_df, country, region)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + \n  geom_point(aes(y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted)) + \n  ggh4x::facet_nested_wrap(~ region + country) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThis is much better! We have a much more accurate model that accounts for what is going on at the country level."

    "text": "Random effects: a brief introduction\nWhat is going on? To start, we fit this very simple (and familiar) linear regression model:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Year + \\epsilon\n\\]\nYou’ll remember that we assume that the error term (\\(\\epsilon\\)) is normally distributed, centered at zero, and has some standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)).\nFormally, we can write this as:\n\\[\n\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)\n\\]\nBut, as we saw, there is a lot of variation in that \\(\\beta_0\\). It’s the average life expectancy across all countries in 2000 (our baseline year). Averages are very useful summaries, but they come at a cost of information. Let’s see what we lost:\n\nfull_df |&gt; \n  filter(year == 0) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = life_exp)) + \n  stat_halfeye() + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nWe reduced all of these values to just one summary value: the average (represented by that lonely dot). This is often very useful! Remember, the goal of statistical analysis is to learn general patterns in our data. But when your data are nested (i.e. within countries within regions), we need to be careful not to miss important factors that influence the relationship we are interested in learning about.\nTo illustrate, let’s assume that there are country-specific difference in the relationship between life expectancy and time. That’s why we see such a large difference between, say, Canada and Myanmar. Both countries’ populations had average life expectancies that grew between 2015 and 2016, and between 2016 and 2017. But they started at different, country-specific spots.\nWhen we do not account for the nested structure of our data, we miss these differences. But that doesn’t mean they don’t exist. It just means that they are hidden from us, sitting in the error term.\n\nYour error is too full\nThe error term above accounts for all of the variation in average life expectancy that is not captured by the baseline average life expectancy (captured by the intercept) and average annual growth across all countries (captured by the coefficient on year). This includes a whole bunch of country-specific variance (represented below as \\(b_{country}\\)):\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Year + (b_{country} + \\epsilon)\n\\]\nNow, we can (and should!) account for that \\(b_{country}\\).\nFor example, imagine that we have the following model for Australia’s average life expectancy over time:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy_{Australia} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Year + (b_{Australia} + \\epsilon)\n\\]\nThis model suggests that there is a general relationship between any country’s average life expectancy and time. This relationship applies to all countries globally and across time. However, we do not always observe a country’s average life expectancy perfectly following this relationship. There is some variance. All good and familiar so far.\nPreviously, we have relied on our random error term (\\(\\epsilon\\)) to capture this variance. However, the model written above suggests that there is also a country-specific effect that serves as an additional source of variance. \\(b_{Australia}\\) captures the variance that we observe just because Australia is Australia.\nMore generally, we can model the following:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Year + (b_{country} + \\epsilon)\n\\]\nNow, we can make some assumptions about the shape of that country-specific variance, just as we do for the other random variance. We assume that the country-specific variance from the general pattern is normally distributed, centered at zero, and has some standard deviation (\\(\\tau\\)).\nFormally, we can write this as:\n\\[\nb_{country} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\tau)\n\\]\nThese variances from the general trend are still random. In fact, the only difference between this model and our more simple (and familiar) linear regression is this country-specific variance (\\(b_{country}\\)). On average, this difference is zero! But often this varies by country and that variance is, on average, \\(\\tau\\).\nAbove we accounted for changes in the starting point for each country. In other words, we adjusted the intercept to reflect each country’s average life expectancy in year 0. Explicitly, we modeled the country-specific error as:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + b_{0,country} + \\beta_1 Year + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSkip this if you aren’t comfy with the content so far!\nWe can also model the error term as:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Year + b_{1,country} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nThis will customize the slope of our linear regression to reflect country-specific growth rates. How cool! For example, Ethiopia’s growth rate is much larger than Canada’s. This is how we account for this difference.\nFurther, we can model that country-specific error as follows:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + b_{0,country} + \\beta_1 Year + b_{1,country} + \\epsilon\n\\]\nNow we have a custom starting point and slope for each country! Multi-level modelling is awesome.\n\n\n\n\nWhy not just include a country variable as we did above?\nTo capture the country-specific starting points of the relationship between average life expectancy and time, we simply added the country as a variable into our model. This approach is good at capturing that different starting point, but falls down in capturing the uncertainty around those starting points.\nThis is because this approach is over-contextualized: it ignores what each country has in common. The multi-level modelling approach introduced above explicitly parses out what countries have in common, and how their unique quirks make them deviate from this common relationship.\nFurther, we often don’t have a lot of information on each observation. Here, we are fitting several regression lines using only 20 data points (one for each year observed for each country). The multi-level modelling approach allows us to build our understanding of the relationship across all available data.\nHowever, the above approach introduces the intuition behind accounting for the structure of your data in a way I find more intuitive than the multi-level approach. You can carry that logic with you through the following explanation."

We are going to fit the following model:\n\\[\nAverage\\ life\\ expectancy = \\beta_0 + b_{0, country} + \\beta_1 Year + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as a random-intercept model because we create different starting points for each group in our data.\n\n\nIn R, we use the lme4::lme() function:\n\nm_multi &lt;- lmer(life_exp ~ year + (1 | country), data = full_df)\n\nmodelsummary(m_multi, coef_rename = c(year = \"Year\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n67.568\n\n\n\n(0.591)\n\n\nYear\n0.290\n\n\n\n(0.004)\n\n\nSD (Intercept country)\n8.584\n\n\nSD (Observations)\n1.503\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n4409\n\n\nR2 Marg.\n0.039\n\n\nR2 Cond.\n0.971\n\n\nAIC\n17498.1\n\n\nBIC\n17523.6\n\n\nICC\n1.0\n\n\nRMSE\n1.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look back at the results of the simple model we fit at the start, we will see very similar coefficients to those captured here. The estimated average life expectancy in 2000 across all countries globally was 67.52 years. This estimated average is increasing by an average of 0.29 years annually.\nThe magic is happening a little under the hood in our errors. They are reported in those two new lines: SD (Intercept country) and SD (Observations).\nOur model has separated out the global relationship (not affected by country-specific factors) and the country-specific features.\nThe fixed effects describe the overall relationship within our data. This is similar to your standard linear regression model fit across all observations. In other words, this is the global average and global growth in average life expectancy. We can isolate these components:\n\ntidy(m_multi, effects = \"fixed\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  effect term        estimate std.error statistic\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 fixed  (Intercept)   67.6     0.591       114. \n2 fixed  year           0.290   0.00374      77.6\n\n\nThese can be interpreted exactly as we would any other linear regression coefficients.\nAdditionally, we have some very rich information about how this relationship differs between countries stored in the group-level effects (our group here is countries):\n\ntidy(m_multi, effects = \"ran_pars\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  effect   group    term            estimate\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 ran_pars country  sd__(Intercept)     8.58\n2 ran_pars Residual sd__Observation     1.50\n\n\nThis gives us the estimated variance for average life expectancy across countries: 8.58. As we move from country to country, how much does the average life expectancy change on average? 8.58 years!\nThis difference is much larger than changes to average life expectancy associated with our main independent variable: year. In terms of substantive meaning, which country you are looking at matters more than which years you are moving between.\nWe also have an estimate of the remaining unexplained variation in life expectancy: 1.5 years. Together with the country-specific variance, we see that countries tend to randomly deviate from the general pattern by 10.09 years.\nThis is great because we have now captured the country-specific component of our error (changes in average life expectancy not captured by the global average in our baseline year and annual changes). And it’s substantial! It makes up 85% of the total error in our model.\nHow does our model perform?\n\naugment(m_multi) |&gt; \n  filter(country %in% countries) |&gt; \n  left_join(\n    distinct(full_df, country, region)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = year)) + \n  geom_point(aes(y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_line(aes(y = .fitted)) + \n  ggh4x::facet_nested_wrap(~ region + country) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nLooks good!"

    "text": "Relationship between health and wealth\nOkay, so we now have a good understanding of how each country’s average life expectancy grows over time. We have accounted for both time and the nested structure of our data.\nBut now we want to explore a more interesting relationship: that between health and wealth. We know from previous classes that a country’s average life expectancy tends to grow with its GDP. How can we formalize that whilst accounting for differences in the relationship over time and between countries?\nFirst, let’s look at the relationship between health and wealth across all countries and years:\n\nggplot(full_df, aes(x = gdp, y = life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"GDP (USD)\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (years)\")\n\n\n\n\nYikes! That’s not very clear or linear. Happily, we can transform our data and uncover a linear relationship:\n\nfull_df &lt;- full_df |&gt; \n  mutate(log_gdp = log(gdp),\n         log_life_exp = log(life_exp))\n\nggplot(full_df, aes(x = log_gdp, y = log_life_exp)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"GDP (logged USD)\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (logged years)\")\n\n\n\n\nGreat! This is clearer and we can detect a (noisy) linear and positive relationship lurking in that cloud.\nEach point in this cloud represents one country’s GDP and average life expectancy in one year. This visualization does not tell us much about that fact. Let’s adjust it:\n\nggplot(full_df, aes(x = log_gdp, y = log_life_exp, group = country)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + \n  geom_line(alpha = 0.25) + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(x = \"GDP (logged USD)\",\n       y = \"Average life expectancy (logged years)\")\n\n\n\n\nOh gosh. Okay, so we now have a better understanding of the structure of our data but it’s still a mess. We can see some fairly linear and positive relationships running around, but there are also some that are bouncing around and some that look like they might have a flatter relationship than others. We will need to account for this diversity by fitting a multi-level model with country groupings.\n\nm_multi &lt;- lmer(log_life_exp ~ log_gdp + year + (1 | country), data = full_df)\n\nmodelsummary(m_multi, coef_rename = c(log_gdp = \"GDP (US$, logged)\", year = \"Year\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n (1)\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n4.141\n\n\n\n(0.009)\n\n\nGDP (US$, logged)\n0.025\n\n\n\n(0.001)\n\n\nYear\n0.003\n\n\n\n(0.000)\n\n\nSD (Intercept country)\n0.121\n\n\nSD (Observations)\n0.026\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n4230\n\n\nR2 Marg.\n0.214\n\n\nR2 Cond.\n0.965\n\n\nAIC\n−17520.3\n\n\nBIC\n−17488.6\n\n\nICC\n1.0\n\n\nRMSE\n0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did we find? Well the intercept isn’t interesting on its own. It provides the estimated average life expectancy among countries that have a GDP of $1 (or a logged GDP of $0) in the year 2000 (where year = 0). But we do find a statistically significant, positive relationship between GDP and average life expectancy."
